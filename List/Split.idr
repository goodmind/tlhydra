data Delimiter a = MkDelimiter (List (a -> Bool))

||| What to do with delimiters?
data DelimPolicy : Type where
  ||| Drop delimiters from the output.
  Drop : DelimPolicy

  ||| Keep delimiters as separate chunks of the output.
  Keep : DelimPolicy

  ||| Keep delimiters in the output, prepending them to the following chunk.
  KeepLeft : DelimPolicy

  ||| Keep delimiters in the output, appending them to the following chunk.
  KeepRight : DelimPolicy

||| What to do with multiple consecutive delimiters?
data CondensePolicy : Type where
  ||| Condense into a single delimiter.
  Condense : CondensePolicy

  ||| Keep consecutive delimiters separate, but don't insert blank chunks in
  ||| between them.
  DropBlankFields : CondensePolicy

  ||| Insert blank chunks between consecutive delimiters.

||| What to do with a blank chunk at either end of the list
||| (i.e. when the list begins or ends with a delimiter).

  ||| in output, or merge with previous or following chunks)

  condensePolicy : CondensePolicy

  ||| Drop an initial blank?

  ||| Drop a final blank?
  finalBlankPolicy : EndPolicy

||| The default splitting strategy: keep delimiters in the output
||| as separate chunks, don't condense multiple consecutive
||| delimiters into one, keep initial and final blank chunks.
||| Default delimiter is the constantly false predicate.
|||
||| Note that 'defaultSplitter' should normally not be used; use
||| 'oneOf', 'onSublist', or 'whenElt' instead, which are the same as
||| the 'defaultSplitter' with just the delimiter overridden.
|||
||| The 'defaultSplitter' strategy with any delimiter gives a
||| maximally information-preserving splitting strategy, in the sense
||| that (a) taking the 'concat' of the output yields the original
||| list, and (b) given only the output list, we can reconstruct a
||| 'Splitter' which would produce the same output list again given
||| the original input list.  This default strategy can be overridden
||| to allow discarding various sorts of information.

-- Combinators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Split a list according to the given splitting strategy.  This is
||| how to \"run\" a 'Splitter' that has been built using the other
||| combinators.
split : Splitter a -> List a -> List (List a)
split s = map fromElem . postProcess s . splitInternal (delimiter s)

||| A splitting strategy that splits on any one of the given
||| elements.  For example:
|||
||| > split (oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aa","z","b","x","","y","","z","c","x","d"]
oneOf : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
oneOf elts = record { delimiter = MkDelimiter [(flip elem elts)] } defaultSplitter

||| A splitting strategy that splits on the given list, when it is
||| encountered as an exact subsequence.  For example:
|||
||| > split (onSublist "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aazb","xyz","cxd"]
|||
||| Note that splitting on the empty list is a special case, which
||| splits just before every element of the list being split.  For example:
|||
||| > split (onSublist "") "abc" == ["","","a","","b","","c"]
||| > split (dropDelims . dropBlanks $ onSublist "") "abc" == ["a","b","c"]
|||
||| However, if you want to break a list into singleton elements like
||| this, you are better off using @'chunksOf' 1@, or better yet,
||| `'map' (:[])`.
onSublist : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
onSublist lst = record { delimiter = MkDelimiter (map (==) lst) } defaultSplitter

||| A splitting strategy that splits on any elements that satisfy the
||| given predicate.  For example:
|||
||| > split (whenElt (<0)) [2,4,-3,6,-9,1] == [[2,4],[-3],[6],[-9],[1]]
whenElt : (a -> Bool) -> Splitter a
whenElt p = record { delimiter = MkDelimiter [p] } defaultSplitter

||| Drop delimiters from the output (the default is to keep
||| them). For example,
|||
||| > split (oneOf ":") "a:b:c" == ["a", ":", "b", ":", "c"]
||| > split (dropDelims $ oneOf ":") "a:b:c" == ["a", "b", "c"]
dropDelims : Splitter a -> Splitter a
dropDelims s = record { delimPolicy = Drop } s

||| Keep delimiters in the output by prepending them to adjacent
||| chunks.  For example:
|||
||| > split (keepDelimsL $ oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aa","zb","x","y","zc","xd"]
keepDelimsL : Splitter a -> Splitter a
keepDelimsL s = record { delimPolicy = KeepLeft } s

||| Keep delimiters in the output by appending them to adjacent
||| chunks. For example:
|||
||| > split (keepDelimsR $ oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aaz","bx","y","z","cx","d"]
keepDelimsR : Splitter a -> Splitter a
keepDelimsR s = record { delimPolicy = KeepRight } s

||| Condense multiple consecutive delimiters into one.  For example:
|||
||| > split (condense $ oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aa","z","b","xyz","c","x","d"]
||| > split (dropDelims $ oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aa","b","","","c","d"]
||| > split (condense . dropDelims $ oneOf "xyz") "aazbxyzcxd" == ["aa","b","c","d"]
condense : Splitter a -> Splitter a
condense s = record { condensePolicy = Condense } s

||| Don't generate a blank chunk if there is a delimiter at the
||| beginning.  For example:
|||
||| > split (oneOf ":") ":a:b" == ["",":","a",":","b"]
||| > split (dropInitBlank $ oneOf ":") ":a:b" == [":","a",":","b"]
dropInitBlank : Splitter a -> Splitter a
dropInitBlank s = record { initBlankPolicy = DropBlank } s

||| Don't generate a blank chunk if there is a delimiter at the end.
||| For example:
|||
||| > split (oneOf ":") "a:b:" == ["a",":","b",":",""]
||| > split (dropFinalBlank $ oneOf ":") "a:b:" == ["a",":","b",":"]
dropFinalBlank : Splitter a -> Splitter a
dropFinalBlank s = record { finalBlankPolicy = DropBlank } s

||| Don't generate blank chunks between consecutive delimiters.
||| For example:
|||
||| > split (oneOf ":") "::b:::a" == ["",":","",":","b",":","",":","",":","a"]
||| > split (dropInnerBlanks $ oneOf ":") "::b:::a" == ["", ":",":","b",":",":",":","a"]
dropInnerBlanks : Splitter a -> Splitter a
dropInnerBlanks s = record { condensePolicy = DropBlankFields } s

||| Drop all blank chunks from the output, and condense consecutive
||| delimiters into one.  Equivalent to @'dropInitBlank'
||| . 'dropFinalBlank' . 'condense'@.  For example:
|||
||| > split (oneOf ":") "::b:::a" == ["",":","",":","b",":","",":","",":","a"]
||| > split (dropBlanks $ oneOf ":") "::b:::a" == ["::","b",":::","a"]
dropBlanks : Splitter a -> Splitter a
dropBlanks = dropInitBlank . dropFinalBlank . condense

||| Make a strategy that splits a list into chunks that all start
||| with the given subsequence (except possibly the first).
||| Equivalent to @'dropInitBlank' . 'keepDelimsL' . 'onSublist'@.
||| For example:
|||
||| > split (startsWith "app") "applyapplicativeapplaudapproachapple" == ["apply","applicative","applaud","approach","apple"]
startsWith : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
startsWith = dropInitBlank . keepDelimsL . onSublist

||| Make a strategy that splits a list into chunks that all start
||| with one of the given elements (except possibly the first).
||| Equivalent to @'dropInitBlank' . 'keepDelimsL' . 'oneOf'@.  For
||| example:
--
||| > split (startsWithOneOf ['A'..'Z']) "ACamelCaseIdentifier" == ["A","Camel","Case","Identifier"]
startsWithOneOf : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
startsWithOneOf = dropInitBlank . keepDelimsL . oneOf

||| Make a strategy that splits a list into chunks that all end with
||| the given subsequence, except possibly the last.  Equivalent to
||| `'dropFinalBlank' . 'keepDelimsR' . 'onSublist'`.  For example:
|||
||| > split (endsWith "ly") "happilyslowlygnarlylily" == ["happily","slowly","gnarly","lily"]
endsWith : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
endsWith = dropFinalBlank . keepDelimsR . onSublist

||| Make a strategy that splits a list into chunks that all end with
||| one of the given elements, except possibly the last.  Equivalent
||| to `'dropFinalBlank' . 'keepDelimsR' . 'oneOf'`.  For example:
|||
||| > split (condense $ endsWithOneOf ".,?! ") "Hi, there!  How are you?" == ["Hi, ","there!  ","How ","are ","you?"]
endsWithOneOf : Eq a => List a -> Splitter a
endsWithOneOf = dropFinalBlank . keepDelimsR . oneOf

||| These functions implement some common splitting strategies.  Note
||| that all of the functions in this section drop delimiters from
||| the final output, since that is a more common use case even
||| though it is not the default.
|||
||| Split on any of the given elements.  Equivalent to @'split'
||| . 'dropDelims' . 'oneOf'@.  For example:
|||
||| > splitOneOf ";.," "foo,bar;baz.glurk" == ["foo","bar","baz","glurk"]
splitOneOf : Eq a => List a -> List a -> List (List a)
splitOneOf = List.Split.split . dropDelims . oneOf

||| A helper for splitOneOf that handles packing and unpacking Strings behind
||| the scenes.
splitOneOf' : String -> String -> List String
splitOneOf' sp str = map pack (splitOneOf (unpack sp) (unpack str))

||| Split on the given sublist.  Equivalent to `'split'
||| . 'dropDelims' . 'onSublist'`.  For example:
|||
||| > splitOn ".." "a..b...c....d.." == ["a","b",".c","","d",""]
|||
||| In some parsing combinator frameworks this is also known as
||| `sepBy`.
|||
||| Note that this is the right inverse of the 'intercalate' function
||| from "Data.List", that is,
|||
||| > intercalate x . splitOn x === id
|||
||| `'splitOn' x . 'intercalate' x` is the identity on
||| certain lists, but it is tricky to state the precise conditions
||| under which this holds.  (For example, it is not enough to say
||| that `x` does not occur in any elements of the input list.
||| Working out why is left as an exercise for the reader.)
splitOn : Eq a => List a -> List a -> List (List a)
splitOn = List.Split.split . dropDelims . onSublist

||| A helper for splitOn that handles packing and unpacking Strings behind the
||| scenes.
splitOn' : String -> String -> List String
splitOn' sp str = map pack (splitOn (unpack sp) (unpack str))

replace : Eq a => List a -> List a -> List a -> List a
replace old new = intercalate new . splitOn old

replace' : String -> String -> String -> String
replace' old new = pack . intercalate (unpack new) . splitOn (unpack old) . unpack

||| Split on elements satisfying the given predicate.  Equivalent to
||| `'split' . 'dropDelims' . 'whenElt'`.  For example:
|||
||| > splitWhen (<0) [1,3,-4,5,7,-9,0,2] == [[1,3],[5,7],[0,2]]
splitWhen : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List (List a)
splitWhen = List.Split.split . dropDelims . whenElt

||| Split into chunks terminated by the given subsequence.
||| Equivalent to `'split' . 'dropFinalBlank' . 'dropDelims'
||| . 'onSublist'`.  For example:
--
||| > endBy ";" "foo;bar;baz;" == ["foo","bar","baz"]
--
||| Note also that the 'lines' function from "Data.List" is equivalent
||| to `'endBy' \"\\n\"`.
endBy : Eq a => List a -> List a -> List (List a)
endBy = List.Split.split . dropFinalBlank . dropDelims . onSublist

||| Split into chunks terminated by one of the given elements.
||| Equivalent to `'split' . 'dropFinalBlank' . 'dropDelims'
||| . 'oneOf'`. For example:
|||
||| > endByOneOf ";," "foo;bar,baz;" == ["foo","bar","baz"]
endByOneOf : Eq a => List a -> List a -> List (List a)
endByOneOf = List.Split.split . dropFinalBlank . dropDelims . oneOf

||| Split into \"words\", with word boundaries indicated by the given
||| predicate.  Satisfies `'Data.List.words' === wordsBy
||| 'Data.Char.isSpace'`; equivalent to `'split' . 'dropBlanks'
||| . 'dropDelims' . 'whenElt'`.  For example:
|||
||| > wordsBy (=='x') "dogxxxcatxbirdxx" == ["dog","cat","bird"]
wordsBy : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List (List a)
wordsBy = List.Split.split . dropBlanks . dropDelims . whenElt

||| Split into \"lines\", with line boundaries indicated by the given
||| predicate. Satisfies `'lines' === linesBy (=='\n')`; equivalent to
||| `'split' . 'dropFinalBlank' . 'dropDelims' . 'whenElt'`.  For example:
|||
||| > linesBy (=='x') "dogxxxcatxbirdxx" == ["dog","","","cat","bird",""]
linesBy : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List (List a)
linesBy = List.Split.split . dropFinalBlank . dropDelims . whenElt

build : ((a -> List a -> List a) -> List a -> List a) -> List a
build g = g (::) []

||| `'chunksOf' n` splits a list into length-n pieces.  The last
||| piece will be shorter if `n` does not evenly divide the length of
||| the list.  If `n <= 0`, `'chunksOf' n l` returns an infinite list
||| of empty lists.  For example:
|||
||| Note that `'chunksOf' n []` is `[]`, not `[[]]`.  This is
||| intentional, and is consistent with a recursive definition of
||| 'chunksOf'; it satisfies the property that
|||
||| `chunksOf n xs ++ chunksOf n ys == chunksOf n (xs ++ ys)`
|||
||| whenever `n` evenly divides the length of `xs`.
chunksOf : Nat -> List e -> List (List e)
chunksOf i ls = map (take i) (build (splitter ls)) where
  splitter : List e -> (List e -> a -> a) -> a -> a
  splitter [] _ n = n
  splitter l c n  = l `c` splitter (drop i l) c n

||| Split a list into chunks of the given lengths. For example:
|||
||| > splitPlaces [2,3,4] [1..20] == [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]
||| > splitPlaces [4,9] [1..10] == [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9,10]]
||| > splitPlaces [4,9,3] [1..10] == [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9,10]]
|||
||| If the input list is longer than the total of the given lengths,
||| then the remaining elements are dropped. If the list is shorter
||| than the total of the given lengths, then the result may contain
||| fewer chunks than requested, and the last chunk may be shorter
||| than requested.
splitPlaces : List Nat -> List e -> List (List e)
splitPlaces is ys = build (splitPlacer is ys) where
  splitPlacer : List Nat -> List b -> (List b -> t -> t) -> t -> t
  splitPlacer [] _ _ n         = n
  splitPlacer _ [] _ n         = n
  splitPlacer (l :: ls) xs c n = let (x1, x2) = splitAt l xs
                                 in  x1 `c` splitPlacer ls x2 c n

||| Split a list into chunks of the given lengths. Unlike
||| 'splitPlaces', the output list will always be the same length as
||| the first input argument. If the input list is longer than the
||| total of the given lengths, then the remaining elements are
||| dropped. If the list is shorter than the total of the given
||| lengths, then the last several chunks will be shorter than
||| requested or empty. For example:
|||
||| > splitPlacesBlanks [2,3,4] [1..20] == [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]
||| > splitPlacesBlanks [4,9] [1..10] == [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9,10]]
||| > splitPlacesBlanks [4,9,3] [1..10] == [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9,10],[]]
|||
||| Notice the empty list in the output of the third example, which
||| differs from the behavior of 'splitPlaces'.
splitPlacesBlanks : List Nat -> List e -> List (List e)
splitPlacesBlanks is ys = build (splitPlacer is ys) where
  splitPlacer : List Nat -> List b -> (List b -> t -> t) -> t -> t
  splitPlacer [] _ _ n         = n
  splitPlacer (l :: ls) xs c n = let (x1, x2) = splitAt l xs
                                 in  x1 `c` splitPlacer ls x2 c n

||| A useful recursion pattern for processing a list to produce a new
||| list, often used for \"chopping\" up the input list.  Typically
||| chop is called with some function that will consume an initial
||| prefix of the list and produce a value and the rest of the list.
|||
||| For example, many common Prelude functions can be implemented in
||| terms of `chop`:
|||
||| > group :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]]
||| > group = chop (\ xs@(x:_) -> span (==x) xs)
||| >
||| > words :: String -> [String]
||| > words = filter (not . null) . chop (span (not . isSpace) . dropWhile isSpace)
chop : (List a -> (b, List a)) -> List a -> List b
chop _ [] = []
chop f as = let (b, as') = f as in b :: chop f as'
